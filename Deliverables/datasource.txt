Data Source Description

Our project uses data that was entirely created by our team for testing and demonstrating the polling application. 
We included a mixture of realistic UGA-related polls and automatically generated sample polls so that the database 
would contain meaningful content as well as enough volume for performance testing. The realistic polls and their 
answer options were written manually by our group, while the large set of additional sample polls was generated 
inside MySQL using a stored procedure. This gave us over 1000 rows in the Poll table, which satisfies the project 
requirement for high-volume data. No outside datasets were used; everything was authored or generated by our team.

Our dataset includes:

Manually created UGA-themed polls (e.g., “Favorite CS Professor?”, “Best Study Spot on Campus?”).

Manually created realistic answer options for those polls.

Five example user accounts representing different student profiles.

Over 1000 automatically generated sample polls created using a MySQL stored procedure.

All data stored directly in MySQL and fully reproducible through the included data.sql file.
