Security Description

For this project, we made sure that user passwords are stored safely rather than in
plain text. To do this, we used the bcrypt library, which is a common and reliable
way to protect passwords in real applications.

When a user creates an account, the password they enter is immediately hashed with
bcrypt before it is saved in the database. Bcrypt also adds a unique salt each time,
so even if two people use the same password, the stored hashes will look completely
different. This makes it much harder for anyone to guess or reverse a password just
by looking at the database.

During login, we do not compare raw passwords. Instead, the backend takes the password
the user enters, hashes it again with bcrypt, and checks if it matches the hash we
already have stored.
